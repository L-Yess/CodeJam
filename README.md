Each problem folder contains at least two files:
  *program.py*     : contains the main code to solve the problem
   *input_set.txt* : contains the sample test data to test the program before submitting to google servers.
   *other files*   : custom modules, text file generated data, etc...
   
   
   
# How to run a program:
  each script needs input data at runtime, so in order to provide this data we need to issue the following command:
    
      >_  py program.py < input_set.txt   (windows)
      
      >_  cat input_set.txt | python3 program.py  (Linux and MacOs)
